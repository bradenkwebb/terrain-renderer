# Terrain Renderer

## Set-up
To build and run this program on Windows, the following tools should be available:

```
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version
```
In order to use the C/C++ debugger on VS Code, I also make sure to open the directory by running the
Developer Command Prompt for VS, navigating to the directory, and running `code .` from within the directory.
